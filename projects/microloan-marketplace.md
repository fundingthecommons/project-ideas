# Microloan Marketplace

## Overview

A decentralized peer-to-peer microloan platform that leverages smart contracts to match lenders and borrowers, utilizing stablecoins for lending, on-chain reputation scores for creditworthiness assessment, and automated repayment mechanisms to ensure loan compliance and reduce default risk.

## Problem Statement

Traditional microfinance institutions often have high overhead costs, limited geographical reach, and inflexible lending terms. Many individuals and small businesses in developing economies lack access to credit due to absence of traditional credit history or collateral. Meanwhile, potential lenders seeking to support financial inclusion face barriers in directly connecting with verified borrowers and ensuring repayment.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Components

1. **Smart Contract Loan Engine**
   - Automated loan origination and management
   - Collateralized and uncollateralized loan options
   - Flexible interest rate models
   - Multi-signature approval for larger loans

2. **Reputation System**
   - On-chain credit scoring based on repayment history
   - Integration with DeFi protocols for activity tracking
   - Verifiable credentials for identity and income verification
   - Social attestations from community members

3. **Stablecoin Integration**
   - Primary lending in USDC, USDT, DAI
   - Automatic currency conversion options
   - Protection against volatility
   - Cross-border transaction support

4. **Automated Repayment Infrastructure**
   - Scheduled payment smart contracts
   - Grace period and penalty mechanisms
   - Partial payment acceptance
   - Automatic collateral liquidation if applicable

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Infrastructure
```solidity
// Loan Factory Contract
contract MicroloanFactory {
    struct Loan {
        address borrower;
        address lender;
        uint256 principal;
        uint256 interestRate;
        uint256 term;
        uint256 repaidAmount;
        LoanStatus status;
        uint256 reputationRequirement;
    }
    
    enum LoanStatus {
        Requested,
        Funded,
        Active,
        Repaid,
        Defaulted
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Loan) public loans;
    mapping(address => uint256) public reputationScores;
}

// Repayment Automation
contract RepaymentScheduler {
    function schedulePayment(
        uint256 loanId,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 dueDate
    ) external;
    
    function processAutomaticPayment(
        uint256 loanId
    ) external returns (bool success);
}
```

### Reputation Engine
```javascript
// Reputation calculation logic
const calculateReputation = (user) => {
    const factors = {
        repaymentHistory: getRepaymentScore(user),
        loanVolume: getTotalVolume(user),
        timeliness: getTimelinessScore(user),
        socialAttestations: getAttestations(user),
        externalCredentials: getVerifiedCredentials(user)
    };
    
    return weightedAverage(factors);
};
```
