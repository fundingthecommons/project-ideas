# Stablecoin Swap Aggregator

A decentralized application that aggregates liquidity across multiple DEXs, bridges, and cross-chain messaging protocols to provide users with the best exchange rates for swapping between global and local stablecoins.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The stablecoin ecosystem is fragmented across multiple chains, protocols, and geographic regions. Users face challenges when trying to:
- Find the best exchange rates between different stablecoins
- Navigate liquidity fragmentation across chains
- Swap between global stablecoins (USDC, USDT) and local/regional stablecoins (XSGD, EUROC, BRLA)
- Minimize slippage and fees when executing large trades

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Build a comprehensive stablecoin swap aggregator that:
1. **Aggregates liquidity** from multiple DEXs on various chains
2. **Finds optimal routes** for swaps, including multi-hop and cross-chain paths
3. **Integrates bridges and LayerZero** for seamless cross-chain execution
4. **Provides a unified interface** for all stablecoin swaps

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Liquidity Aggregation Engine**
   - Real-time indexing of liquidity pools across DEXs
   - Support for major protocols: Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, PancakeSwap
   - Track pool depths, fees, and slippage parameters

2. **Routing Algorithm**
   - Pathfinding for optimal swap routes
   - Multi-hop route calculation
   - Cross-chain route optimization
   - Gas cost estimation and optimization

3. **Cross-Chain Infrastructure**
   - LayerZero integration for omnichain messaging
   - Bridge aggregation (Stargate, Wormhole, Across)
   - Unified liquidity layer across chains

4. **Smart Contract System**
   - Router contracts on each supported chain
   - Meta-transaction support for gasless swaps
   - Slippage protection and MEV resistance

### Supported Chains

- **EVM Chains**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche
- **Non-EVM**: Solana, Aptos, Sui (via LayerZero)

### Supported Stablecoins

**Global Stablecoins:**
- USDC, USDT, DAI, FRAX, BUSD

**Regional/Local Stablecoins:**
- EUROC (Euro)
- XSGD (Singapore Dollar)
- BRLA (Brazilian Real)
- JPYC (Japanese Yen)
- AUDC (Australian Dollar)

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Smart Routing
- **Split routing**: Divide large swaps across multiple pools
- **Multi-hop optimization**: Find best intermediate tokens
- **Cross-chain routing**: Seamless swaps across chains

### 2. Price Optimization
- **Real-time quotes** from all integrated sources
- **Slippage calculation** and protection
- **Gas cost inclusion** in route selection

### 3. User Experience
- **One-click swaps** regardless of source/destination chain
- **Transaction batching** for complex routes
- **Failed transaction protection** with automatic retries

### 4. Advanced Features
- **Limit orders** for stablecoin swaps
- **Recurring swaps** for DCA strategies
- **Arbitrage detection** and execution

## 📊 Revenue Model

1. **Protocol Fees**: Small fee (0.05-0.1%) on swaps
2. **Premium Features**: Advanced routing, priority execution
3. **API Access**: Institutional access to aggregation API
4. **MEV Capture**: Capture and redistribute MEV profits

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Audit all adapters** for each integrated protocol
- **Implement circuit breakers** for unusual market conditions
- **Multi-sig governance** for protocol updates
- **Insurance fund** for potential losses
