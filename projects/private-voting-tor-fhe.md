# Private Voting with Tor + FHE

> **ðŸ“¢ ATTRIBUTION: This project idea originated from the Tor Project's privacy and democracy initiative**
> 
> **Focus: Combining Tor's anonymity with FHE for secure, private voting systems**

---

## Overview

A project to create a prototype "Tor ballot box" that combines Tor's anonymity properties with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to enable private voting where voter choices remain confidential while ensuring the integrity of the voting process. This system addresses the critical need for democratic participation that preserves both privacy and verifiability.

## Problem Statement

Traditional voting systems face a fundamental privacy-integrity trade-off: verifying unique voter identities without exposing individual choices. While FHE enables private counting and computation on encrypted data, it lacks the network-level anonymity that prevents correlation attacks. Voters can be deanonymized through network traffic analysis, compromising the privacy guarantees of the voting system. This project aims to solve this by integrating Tor's proven anonymity layer with FHE-based voting protocols.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Components

1. **Tor-Anonymized Voting Protocol**
   - All voting traffic routed through Tor network
   - Circuit rotation to prevent traffic correlation
   - Onion service endpoints for voting servers
   - Anonymous voter registration and authentication

2. **FHE-Based Voting Cryptography**
   - Encrypted ballot creation and submission
   - Homomorphic vote counting and aggregation
   - Zero-knowledge proofs for vote validity
   - Threshold decryption for result verification

3. **Privacy-Preserving Identity Management**
   - Anonymous credential systems
   - Blind signature schemes for voter verification
   - Decentralized identity without correlation
   - Sybil resistance mechanisms

### Voting Protocol Flow
```rust
// Example FHE voting protocol with Tor integration
use fhe::prelude::*;
use tor_client::TorClient;

pub struct TorVotingSystem {
    fhe_context: FheContext,
    tor_client: TorClient,
    voting_server: OnionService,
}

impl TorVotingSystem {
    pub async fn cast_vote(&self, ballot: EncryptedBallot) -> Result<VoteReceipt, VotingError> {
        // Route through Tor network to prevent deanonymization
        let anonymous_connection = self.tor_client.create_circuit().await?;
        
        // Submit encrypted ballot through anonymous channel
        let receipt = self.voting_server
            .submit_vote(ballot, anonymous_connection)
            .await?;
            
        Ok(receipt)
    }
    
    pub async fn process_votes(&self, encrypted_votes: Vec<EncryptedBallot>) -> Result<VoteCounts, ProcessingError> {
        // Use FHE to compute on encrypted votes
        let encrypted_counts = self.fhe_context
            .homomorphic_sum(encrypted_votes)
            .await?;
            
        // Apply threshold decryption
        let final_counts = self.threshold_decrypt(encrypted_counts).await?;
        
        Ok(final_counts)
    }
}

// Encrypted ballot structure
#[derive(FheEncrypt, FheDecrypt)]
pub struct EncryptedBallot {
    pub voter_id: FheUint64,      // Encrypted voter identifier
    pub choice: FheUint8,         // Encrypted vote choice
    pub timestamp: FheUint64,     // Encrypted timestamp
    pub proof: ZeroKnowledgeProof, // Validity proof
}
```

### Identity Management
```typescript
// Anonymous credential system for voter verification
class AnonymousVoterCredential {
    private torClient: TorClient;
    private credentialSystem: CredentialSystem;
    
    async registerVoter(identityProof: IdentityProof): Promise<AnonymousCredential> {
        // Create anonymous credential through Tor
        const anonymousConnection = await this.torClient.createCircuit();
        
        // Generate blind signature for voter verification
        const credential = await this.credentialSystem.issueCredential({
            identityProof,
            anonymityLevel: 'maximum',
            circuitId: anonymousConnection.id
        });
        
        return credential;
    }
    
    async verifyVoter(credential: AnonymousCredential): Promise<boolean> {
        // Verify credential without revealing identity
        const isValid = await this.credentialSystem.verifyCredential(credential);
        
        // Check for double-voting prevention
        const hasVoted = await this.checkVotingHistory(credential.hash);
        
        return isValid && !hasVoted;
    }
}
```
