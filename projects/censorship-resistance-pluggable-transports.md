# Censorship Resistance via Pluggable Transports

> **ðŸ“¢ ATTRIBUTION: This project idea originated from the Tor Project's censorship circumvention team**
> 
> **Focus: Creating new pluggable transports and user-facing apps to bypass state-level firewalls**

---

## Overview

A project to develop new or improved pluggable transports and user-facing applications that disguise Tor traffic as innocuous, unblockable content such as video games, chat applications, or CDN traffic. This initiative addresses the critical need for censorship resistance by making Tor traffic indistinguishable from everyday internet usage, expanding access for users in repressive environments.

## Problem Statement

Tor's censorship-circumvention team has developed effective tools like Snowflake, bridges, and pluggable transports to bypass state-level firewalls. However, adoption of these technologies lags behind their potential due to the lack of easy entry points and user-friendly applications. Many users in censored regions struggle to access these tools, and existing transports may not be sufficient against increasingly sophisticated censorship techniques. This project aims to bridge this gap by creating more accessible and effective censorship resistance tools.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Components

1. **New Pluggable Transports**
   - **Gaming Transport**: Disguise Tor traffic as video game data
   - **Chat Transport**: Mimic popular messaging protocols
   - **CDN Transport**: Blend with content delivery network traffic
   - **Streaming Transport**: Resemble video streaming data
   - **Social Media Transport**: Appear as social platform traffic

2. **User-Facing Applications**
   - **Stealth Browser**: Browser that automatically uses transports
   - **Gaming Client**: Game launcher with built-in Tor access
   - **Chat Application**: Messaging app with censorship resistance
   - **Media Player**: Streaming app with privacy features
   - **Social Client**: Social media app with Tor integration

3. **Machine Learning Obfuscation**
   - **Traffic Pattern Learning**: ML models to mimic real traffic
   - **Behavioral Cloning**: Replicate user behavior patterns
   - **Adaptive Obfuscation**: Dynamic transport selection
   - **Censorship Detection**: Automatic transport switching

### Gaming Transport Implementation
```rust
// Example gaming transport that disguises Tor traffic
use tor_transport::{PluggableTransport, TransportConfig};
use game_protocol::{GameClient, GamePacket};

pub struct GamingTransport {
    game_client: GameClient,
    tor_stream: TorStream,
    obfuscation_level: ObfuscationLevel,
}

impl PluggableTransport for GamingTransport {
    async fn connect(&self, target: &str) -> Result<TransportStream, TransportError> {
        // Establish connection to game server
        let game_connection = self.game_client.connect().await?;
        
        // Create obfuscated Tor stream
        let tor_stream = self.create_tor_stream(target).await?;
        
        // Wrap Tor traffic in game packets
        let obfuscated_stream = self.obfuscate_traffic(tor_stream, game_connection).await?;
        
        Ok(obfuscated_stream)
    }
    
    async fn obfuscate_traffic(&self, tor_stream: TorStream, game_conn: GameConnection) -> Result<TransportStream, TransportError> {
        // Convert Tor data into game packet format
        let game_packets = self.convert_to_game_packets(tor_stream).await?;
        
        // Add realistic gaming behavior
        let realistic_packets = self.add_gaming_behavior(game_packets).await?;
        
        // Send through game connection
        self.send_game_packets(realistic_packets, game_conn).await?;
        
        Ok(TransportStream::new(game_conn))
    }
}

// Game packet structure for obfuscation
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct GamePacket {
    pub packet_type: GamePacketType,
    pub payload: Vec<u8>,
    pub timestamp: u64,
    pub sequence: u32,
    pub checksum: u32,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum GamePacketType {
    PlayerMovement,
    ChatMessage,
    GameState,
    TorData, // Hidden Tor traffic
}
```

### ML-Driven Obfuscation
```python
# Machine learning model for traffic obfuscation
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

class TrafficObfuscationModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, model_name: str):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.obfuscation_head = nn.Linear(768, 512)
        self.traffic_generator = nn.Linear(512, 256)
        
    def forward(self, tor_traffic: torch.Tensor, target_protocol: str) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Encode Tor traffic
        encoded = self.encoder(tor_traffic)
        
        # Generate obfuscated traffic patterns
        obfuscated = self.obfuscation_head(encoded)
        
        # Generate protocol-specific traffic
        protocol_traffic = self.traffic_generator(obfuscated)
        
        return protocol_traffic
    
    def obfuscate_traffic(self, tor_data: bytes, target_protocol: str) -> bytes:
        # Convert Tor data to tensor
        tor_tensor = self.preprocess_tor_data(tor_data)
        
        # Generate obfuscated traffic
        with torch.no_grad():
            obfuscated = self.forward(tor_tensor, target_protocol)
        
        # Convert back to bytes
        return self.postprocess_traffic(obfuscated)

# Usage example
class MLTransportManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {
            'gaming': TrafficObfuscationModel('gaming-protocol-model'),
            'chat': TrafficObfuscationModel('chat-protocol-model'),
            'streaming': TrafficObfuscationModel('streaming-protocol-model')
        }
        
    async def select_best_transport(self, censorship_level: int) -> str:
        # Use ML to select the most effective transport
        if censorship_level > 8:
            return 'gaming'  # Gaming traffic is least suspicious
        elif censorship_level > 5:
            return 'streaming'  # Streaming is common and hard to block
        else:
            return 'chat'  # Chat protocols are usually allowed
```
