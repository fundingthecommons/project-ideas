# Stablecoin-Based Remittance App

## Overview

A mobile-first decentralized application (dApp) designed for seamless cross-border remittances using stablecoins, featuring instant swaps to local tokens and integrated off-ramp solutions. The app eliminates traditional remittance friction by leveraging blockchain technology to enable fast, low-cost international money transfers with direct conversion to local currencies.

## Problem Statement

Traditional remittance services charge high fees (5-10% on average), take several days to process, and require extensive documentation. Migrant workers sending money home face limited service hours, poor exchange rates, and complex processes. Recipients often need to travel to physical locations to collect funds, creating additional barriers. The $700+ billion remittance market desperately needs a more efficient, accessible solution.

## Proposed Solution

1. **Mobile-First Interface**
   - Intuitive UI/UX for non-technical users
   - Multi-language support
   - Biometric authentication
   - Offline transaction queueing
   - SMS notifications for recipients

2. **Stablecoin Infrastructure**
   - Multi-stablecoin support (USDC, USDT, DAI)
   - Automatic best-rate selection
   - Gas optimization across chains
   - Non-custodial wallet integration

3. **Local Currency Off-Ramps**
   - Direct bank deposits
   - Mobile money integration
   - Cash pickup locations
   - Prepaid card options
   - Local payment networks

4. **Instant Swap Engine**
   - Real-time exchange rates
   - Liquidity aggregation
   - Slippage protection
   - Multi-route optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Layer
```solidity
// Remittance Router Contract
contract RemittanceRouter {
    struct Transfer {
        address sender;
        address recipient;
        uint256 amountIn;
        address tokenIn;
        address tokenOut;
        uint256 expectedAmountOut;
        OffRampMethod offRampMethod;
        bytes offRampData;
    }
    
    enum OffRampMethod {
        BankTransfer,
        MobileMoney,
        CashPickup,
        PrepaidCard
    }
    
    function initiateTransfer(
        Transfer memory transfer
    ) external returns (uint256 transferId);
    
    function executeSwapAndOffRamp(
        uint256 transferId
    ) external;
}

// Liquidity Aggregator
contract LiquidityAggregator {
    function getBestRoute(
        address tokenIn,
        address tokenOut,
        uint256 amount
    ) external view returns (Route memory);
}
```

### Mobile App Architecture
```javascript
// React Native App Structure
const RemittanceApp = {
    // User Management
    authentication: {
        biometric: BiometricAuth,
        pin: PinAuth,
        recovery: SocialRecovery
    },
    
    // Transfer Flow
    transfer: {
        recipientManagement: RecipientModule,
        amountCalculator: FeeCalculator,
        swapEngine: SwapModule,
        offRampSelector: OffRampModule
    },
    
    // Offline Support
    offline: {
        queueManager: OfflineQueue,
        syncEngine: DataSync
    }
};

// Off-Ramp Integration
class OffRampProvider {
    async processWithdrawal(transfer) {
        switch(transfer.method) {
            case 'bank':
                return this.processBankTransfer(transfer);
            case 'mobileMoney':
                return this.processMobileMoney(transfer);
            case 'cash':
                return this.processCashPickup(transfer);
        }
    }
}
```
