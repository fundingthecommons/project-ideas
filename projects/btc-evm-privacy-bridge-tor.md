# BTC-to-EVM Privacy Bridge with Tor

> **ðŸ“¢ ATTRIBUTION: This project idea originated from the Tor Project's cryptocurrency privacy initiative**
> 
> **Focus: Prototyping a system where BTC is bridged to EVM L2 with all network activity routed via Tor/Onion services**

---

## Overview

A project to prototype a Bitcoin-to-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bridge system where all network activity routes through Tor and Onion services to preserve user anonymity. This system addresses the critical need for Bitcoin users to participate in EVM-based funding mechanisms, governance systems, and DeFi protocols while maintaining complete privacy and avoiding the trust and UX hurdles of traditional bridges.

## Problem Statement

Tor users heavily rely on Bitcoin for privacy and censorship resistance, but many funding mechanisms, public goods initiatives, and governance systems operate on EVM chains. Traditional BTC-to-EVM bridges introduce significant UX challenges, trust requirements, and privacy concerns. Users must trust bridge operators, reveal their identities, and risk deanonymization through network traffic analysis. This project aims to solve these issues by creating a privacy-first bridge that routes all activity through Tor's anonymity network.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Components

1. **Privacy-First Bridge Architecture**
   - **Tor-Routed Bridge**: All bridge operations go through Tor network
   - **Onion Service Endpoints**: Bridge services accessible via .onion addresses
   - **Anonymous User Registration**: No KYC or identity requirements
   - **Circuit Rotation**: Automatic Tor circuit management for privacy

2. **Bitcoin Integration Layer**
   - **UTXO Management**: Secure Bitcoin wallet and transaction handling
   - **Multi-Signature Security**: Distributed key management for bridge security
   - **Lightning Network Support**: Fast, low-cost Bitcoin transfers
   - **Privacy-Enhanced Transactions**: CoinJoin and other privacy techniques

3. **EVM Integration Layer**
   - **L2 Bridge Contracts**: Smart contracts for cross-chain asset management
   - **Privacy-Preserving DeFi**: Anonymous yield farming and liquidity provision
   - **Governance Participation**: Anonymous voting and proposal submission
   - **Quadratic Funding**: Privacy-preserving public goods funding
