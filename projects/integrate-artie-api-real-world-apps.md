## Overview

A project to integrate Tor's new Rust-based Artie API into real-world applications, demonstrating how developers can easily add privacy features to their apps. This project aims to create working examples that showcase Artie's cleaner developer experience compared to the legacy C codebase, helping shape the API design and accelerate adoption.

## Problem Statement

Tor's legacy C codebase presents significant barriers for application developers who want to integrate privacy features. The complex integration process, lack of modern developer tooling, and steep learning curve prevent many applications from leveraging Tor's anonymity network. The new Rust rewrite (Artie) promises a much cleaner developer experience, but needs real-world testing and examples to prove its value and guide API design decisions.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Components

1. **Proof-of-Concept Applications**
   - **Privacy Wallet**: Cryptocurrency wallet that routes transactions through Tor
   - **Secure Messaging Client**: Chat application with built-in anonymity
   - **Voting Tool**: Democratic voting system with privacy guarantees
   - **File Sharing App**: Secure file transfer with anonymous routing
   - **Social Media Client**: Privacy-focused social networking

2. **Integration Patterns**
   - Minimal code integration examples
   - Performance benchmarks vs. legacy Tor
   - Error handling and fallback strategies
   - Cross-platform compatibility testing
   - Security best practices documentation

3. **Developer Experience Tools**
   - Integration tutorials and guides
   - Sample code repositories
   - Testing frameworks and mock services
   - Performance profiling tools
   - Debugging and monitoring utilities

## Technical Architecture

### Application Examples

#### Privacy Wallet Integration
```rust
// Example Artie integration in a Rust wallet
use artie::client::{ArtieClient, ConnectionConfig};
use artie::privacy::anonymity::AnonymityLevel;

pub struct PrivacyWallet {
    artie_client: ArtieClient,
    wallet_backend: WalletBackend,
}

impl PrivacyWallet {
    pub async fn new() -> Result<Self, ArtieError> {
        let config = ConnectionConfig::default()
            .anonymity_level(AnonymityLevel::High)
            .circuit_timeout(Duration::from_secs(30));
            
        let artie_client = ArtieClient::connect(config).await?;
        
        Ok(Self {
            artie_client,
            wallet_backend: WalletBackend::new(),
        })
    }
    
    pub async fn send_transaction(&self, tx: Transaction) -> Result<TxHash, WalletError> {
        // Route transaction through Artie's privacy network
        let anonymous_tx = self.artie_client.anonymize_transaction(tx).await?;
        
        // Submit to blockchain through anonymous connection
        let tx_hash = self.wallet_backend.submit_transaction(anonymous_tx).await?;
        
        Ok(tx_hash)
    }
}
```

#### Secure Messaging Client
```typescript
// Example Artie integration in a TypeScript messaging app
import { ArtieClient } from '@artie/client';

class SecureMessenger {
    private artieClient: ArtieClient;
    
    constructor() {
        this.artieClient = new ArtieClient({
            anonymityLevel: 'high',
            circuitTimeout: 30000,
            maxRetries: 3
        });
    }
    
    async sendMessage(recipient: string, message: string): Promise<void> {
        // Encrypt message
        const encrypted = await this.encryptMessage(message, recipient);
        
        // Route through Artie's privacy network
        const anonymousMessage = await this.artieClient.anonymizeMessage({
            content: encrypted,
            recipient,
            timestamp: Date.now()
        });
        
        // Send through anonymous channel
        await this.transmitMessage(anonymousMessage);
    }
    
    async receiveMessages(): Promise<Message[]> {
        // Listen for incoming messages through anonymous channel
        const messages = await this.artieClient.listenForMessages();
        return messages.map(msg => this.decryptMessage(msg));
    }
}
```
