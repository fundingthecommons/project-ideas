# Merchant Loyalty & Cashback Wallet

## Overview

A decentralized wallet application that combines cryptocurrency functionality with merchant loyalty programs and cashback rewards. This wallet enables users to earn and manage loyalty points and cashback from participating merchants while maintaining full control of their digital assets.

## Problem Statement

Traditional loyalty programs are fragmented across different merchants, difficult to track, and often have restrictive redemption policies. Meanwhile, crypto adoption for everyday purchases remains limited due to lack of incentives and merchant integration. There's a need for a unified platform that bridges cryptocurrency payments with tangible rewards that consumers already understand and value.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Components

1. **Multi-Asset Wallet**
   - Support for major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, stablecoins)
   - Integrated loyalty token management
   - Seamless conversion between assets

2. **Merchant Integration Layer**
   - SDK for merchant point-of-sale integration
   - Smart contract-based loyalty program creation
   - Automated cashback distribution system

3. **Rewards Engine**
   - Configurable cashback percentages by merchant
   - Tiered loyalty programs
   - Cross-merchant reward pooling options

4. **User Experience Features**
   - Unified dashboard for all rewards
   - Real-time notifications for earned rewards
   - One-click redemption to preferred cryptocurrency

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Infrastructure
```solidity
// Loyalty Program Factory
contract LoyaltyProgramFactory {
    mapping(address => MerchantProgram) public programs;
    
    struct MerchantProgram {
        uint256 cashbackRate;
        address rewardToken;
        uint256 totalDistributed;
        bool active;
    }
}

// Cashback Distribution
contract CashbackDistributor {
    function processTransaction(
        address user,
        address merchant,
        uint256 amount
    ) external returns (uint256 cashback);
}
```

### Wallet Integration
- Non-custodial architecture with user-controlled keys
- Integration with hardware wallets
- Mobile-first design with QR code payments

### Merchant API
```javascript
// Merchant integration example
const merchantSDK = {
    registerTransaction: async (userId, amount, currency) => {
        // Process payment
        // Calculate cashback
        // Distribute rewards
    },
    
    createLoyaltyTier: async (tierConfig) => {
        // Define tier requirements
        // Set reward multipliers
    }
};
```

## Success Metrics

- Number of active wallet users
- Total transaction volume processed
- Merchant adoption rate
- Average cashback earned per user
- User retention rate (monthly active users)

## Technical Requirements

- EVM-compatible blockchain for smart contracts
- High-performance backend for transaction processing
- Secure key management system
- Real-time notification infrastructure
- Comprehensive merchant dashboard

## Potential Challenges

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Navigating loyalty program and crypto regulations
2. **Merchant Adoption**: Convincing traditional merchants to accept crypto
