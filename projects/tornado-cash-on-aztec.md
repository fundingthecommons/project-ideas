# Tornado Cash on Aztec

Building a privacy-preserving mixer protocol on Aztec Network leverages the platform's native privacy features and zero-knowledge proof capabilities to create a more efficient and scalable privacy solution.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

While Ethereum offers transparency, this comes at the cost of privacy. Users need ways to transact privately without revealing their transaction history or wallet balances. Traditional mixing services on Ethereum require complex cryptographic constructions and are often expensive due to on-chain verification costs.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Implement a Tornado Cash-like protocol natively on Aztec, utilizing its built-in privacy features and efficient zero-knowledge proof system. This would provide:

1. **Native Privacy**: Leverage Aztec's private state model where all transactions are private by default
2. **Efficient Proofs**: Use Aztec's optimized proving system instead of implementing custom circuits
3. **Lower Costs**: Benefit from Aztec's rollup architecture for reduced transaction fees
4. **Composability**: Integrate seamlessly with other private DeFi protocols on Aztec

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Deposit Contract**
   - Accept deposits of fixed denominations (e.g., 0.1, 1, 10, 100 ETH equivalent)
   - Generate commitment notes using Aztec's native note system
   - Store commitments in Aztec's append-only note tree

2. **Withdrawal Mechanism**
   - Verify zero-knowledge proofs of deposit ownership
   - Ensure anonymity set through Aztec's nullifier system
   - Process withdrawals to fresh addresses without linking to deposits

3. **Relayer Network**
   - Optional relayer service for users without gas
   - Incentivized through fees from withdrawal amounts
   - Maintains user privacy by submitting transactions on behalf of users

### Key Features

- **Multi-Asset Support**: Support various tokens beyond ETH
- **Variable Amounts**: Unlike fixed denomination pools, support arbitrary amounts through note splitting
- **Time-Delayed Withdrawals**: Optional feature to increase anonymity set
- **Compliance Tools**: Optional viewing keys for regulatory compliance

└── libraries/
    ├── merkle.nr           # Merkle tree operations
    └── commitments.nr      # Commitment scheme
```

### Deposit Flow

1. User selects deposit amount and generates a secret
2. Compute commitment = hash(secret, nullifier)
3. Submit deposit transaction with commitment
4. Receive private note representing the deposit

### Withdrawal Flow

1. Generate zero-knowledge proof of:
   - Knowledge of secret and nullifier
   - Commitment exists in the tree
   - Nullifier hasn't been used
2. Submit proof with recipient address
3. Contract verifies and transfers funds

## 🚀 Advantages Over Ethereum Implementation

1. **Native Privacy**: No need for complex cryptographic constructions
2. **Cheaper Operations**: Rollup benefits reduce verification costs
3. **Better UX**: Simpler integration with wallets supporting Aztec
4. **Programmable Privacy**: Compose with other private DeFi protocols

## 📊 Potential Enhancements

- **Cross-chain Bridge**: Enable private transfers between Aztec and other chains
- **Yield Generation**: Allow deposits to earn yield while in the pool
- **Governance Token**: Decentralized protocol management
- **Mobile Support**: Lightweight proofs for mobile devices

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Ensure sufficient anonymity set size before allowing withdrawals
- Implement rate limiting to prevent spam attacks
- Regular security audits of circuits and contracts
- Monitor for timing analysis attacks

## 🛣️ Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Basic mixer functionality with fixed denominations
2. **Phase 2**: Variable amount support and relayer network
3. **Phase 3**: Cross-chain capabilities and yield features
4. **Phase 4**: Full decentralization and governance
