## Overview

An open-source Point of Sale (POS) hardware solution designed to democratize payment acceptance for merchants worldwide. This project aims to create affordable, customizable, and secure payment terminals that support both traditional payment methods and cryptocurrencies, enabling small businesses and merchants in developing economies to accept digital payments without expensive proprietary systems.

## Problem Statement

Traditional POS systems are expensive, locked to specific payment processors, charge high transaction fees, and require lengthy contracts. Small merchants, especially in developing countries, cannot afford the $300-1000+ cost of proprietary terminals. Additionally, existing systems don't support cryptocurrency payments, limiting merchants from accepting the growing digital economy. The closed nature of current POS hardware prevents innovation and keeps merchants dependent on large financial institutions.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Components

1. **Open Hardware Design**
   - Publicly available PCB designs and schematics
   - Modular architecture for easy customization
   - Low-cost components (target <$50 BOM)
   - 3D-printable enclosures
   - Multiple form factors (countertop, mobile, integrated)

2. **Flexible Payment Support**
   - NFC for contactless cards and phones
   - Chip card reader (EMV)
   - Magnetic stripe reader (legacy support)
   - QR code scanner for crypto payments
   - Bluetooth/WiFi connectivity

3. **Open Source Software Stack**
   - Linux-based OS optimized for payments
   - Multi-blockchain wallet integration
   - Traditional payment gateway APIs
   - Offline transaction capability
   - Multi-language interface

4. **Security Architecture**
   - Hardware security module (HSM) option
   - Secure boot and encrypted storage
   - PCI compliance ready design
   - Open source security audits
   - Tamper detection mechanisms

    }
};

// Payment Flow
class PaymentProcessor {
    async processPayment(amount, method) {
        if (method.type === 'card') {
            return this.processCardPayment(amount, method);
        } else if (method.type === 'crypto') {
            return this.processCryptoPayment(amount, method);
        }
    }
    
    async processCryptoPayment(amount, currency) {
        // Generate payment request
        // Display QR code
        // Monitor blockchain for payment
        // Confirm transaction
    }
}
